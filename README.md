# React ToDo App
A simple and clean ToDo App built with React, allowing users to add, view, and delete tasks with due dates.


## Features
✅ Add tasks with a due date

🗑️ Delete tasks individually

📭 Welcome message when the list is empty

🎯 Component-based structure using modern React features like useState and props

☀︎ Dark and light Theme


## Tech Stack
React (via npm create vite@latest)
JavaScript (ES6+)
CSS
Bootstrap


## How It Works
The App.jsx maintains the state of all tasks using useState.

Addtodo collects new task inputs and sends them to the main state handler.

TodoitemList displays each task and provides a delete option.

Welcome is conditionally rendered when there are no tasks to show.
